Installation of X2 is fairly simple. 
Please follow the steps below and have fun:

1. In the ./app/Config/Schema/ directory load the schema.sql file into your Database. 
You can use PhpMyAdmin, the command line client or any other tool you like. This step
requires you have a working database server and a blank database.  

2. Open the ./app/Config/database.php file and set your database settings

3. Open the ./app/Config/core.php and change Configure::write('debug', 0); to Configure::write('debug', 2);

4. visit http://yoursitehere.com/x2/pages/requirements and see if you meet all of the requirements.

5. Fix any problems with your installation and once your ready change Configure::write('debug', 2); back to 0

6. visit http://yoursitehere.com/x2/users/register and register the first account.
The first user is automatically made an admin.
