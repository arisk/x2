X2 is a very simple minimalist gallery. After installing go to http://example.com/x2/users/register
and register the first user. Only the first user automatically becomes an admin and after that
you have options to allow registration and a user approval queue. 
In the admin section you can create albums and upload photos. 
The upload area allows drag and drop upload and multiple file uploads.
There are 10 themes to chose from or you can develop your own custom theme with 
Bootstrap CSS and HTML. 

3. Extend
You can use CakePHP plugins to extend the X2's functionality in any way you like.
